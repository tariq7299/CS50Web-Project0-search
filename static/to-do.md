# Project to-do
-   Three html pages, one for reguler google search, another one for google search images, and one for google advanced search.
-   On each google page there should be a link for the other two pages, found in the upper right corner.
-   The user should be able to type any search and them after hitting enter, he should be directed to the search results page.
-   The seach field should be rounded and centered in the page, and the search button should be beneath the search bar.
-   Eaxct same thing for google images search page.
-   For advanced search page it should be like the advanced search page
-   Iam feeling lucky button should take the user to the first search result without displaying the search results
-   CSS should resemble google own aethetics
